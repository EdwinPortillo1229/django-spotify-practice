<h1> Spotify Open AI Playlist Curator </h1>


<p>
  At a point you start getting sick of your same old music. Using Python's Django framework, 
  this app uses Spotify Oauth Flow and API with some help from Open AI API to make a curated playlist for you
</p>

<p>
  Just connect your Spotify account as it guides you, and then choose three artists along with the vibe you would like. 
  From there AI will choose songs for you and I put em straight into your playlists for you to listen to
